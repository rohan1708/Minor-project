       INTRODUCTION
     </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px "><em> The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms (such as Facebook and Twitter) paved the way for information dissemination that has never been witnessed in the human history before. Besides other use cases, news outlets benefitted from the widespread use of social media platforms by providing updated news in near real time to its subscribers. The news media evolved from newspapers, tabloids, and magazines to a digital form such as online news platforms, blogs, social media feeds, and other digital media formats . It became easier for consumers to acquire the latest news at their fingertips. Facebook referrals account for 70% of traffic to news websites. These social media platforms in their current state are extremely powerful and useful for their ability to allow users to discuss and share ideas and debate over issues such as democracy, education, and health. However, such platforms are also used with a negative perspective by certain entities commonly for monetary gain  and in other cases for creating biased opinions, manipulating mindsets, and spreading satire or absurdity. The phenomenon is commonly known as fake news.</em></p>

   <h2> LITERATURE SURVEY ON FACE NEWS DETECTION </h2>
     The available literature has described many
automatic detection techniques of fake news and
deception posts. Since there are multidimensional
aspects of fake news detection ranging from using
chatbots for spread of misinformation to use of
clickbaits for the rumor spreading . There are many
clickbaits available in social media networks
including facebook which enhance sharing and liking of posts which in turn spreads falsified information.
Lot of work has been done to detect falsified
information.
 Various detection techniques have been introduced
by authors in [1] . the authors have introduced
following Detection Methods
1. Linguistics basis
Deception modelling
2. Clustering
3. Predictive modelling
4. Content cue based methods
5. Non text cue based methods The Classification is
purely on the basis of source of the post/tweet. The
Authors used manually collected data sets using
twitter API , DMOZ . The following algorithms where
used on data sets
1. Na√Øve Bayes
2. Descision trees
3. SVM
4. Nueral Networks
5. Random Forest
6. XG Boost.  </p></li>

  <h2> CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p>
    Although there is evident success in detection of
fake news and posts using various Machine learning
approaches. However everchanging characteristics
and features of fake news in social media networks is
posing a challenge in categorization of fake news .
However the main characteristic feature of deep
learning is to compute hierarchical features . With the
implementation of deep learning research and
applications in recent past, lots of research works is
going to implement deep learning methods, like
convolutional Neural Networks , deep Boltzmann
machine , Deep neural network  and Deep
autoencoder model, in various applications, like
audio and speech processing , Natural
language processing and modelling ,
information retrieval, objective recognition
and computer vision , as well as multimodal and
multi-task learning  in categorization of news
posts.
